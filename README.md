# **The Black Sun**
In "The Black Sun of Autocracy", I travel to autocratic countries* using Google Street View. I find and capture digital artifacts that remind me of the essence of this regime. The protagonist of this series is the black circle, aka the black sun that shone over these countries.

*Autocracy (from the Greek. αὐτοϰρᾴτεια) is a form of government that represents the unlimited sovereignty of one person in the state.
